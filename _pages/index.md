## Course Announcements

### 2025-05-19: Course Waitlist

Advance registration for CIS 5650 Fall 2025 is full. Please use the Course Waitlist to ensure that you are considered for the course and receive course communication ahead of the Fall semester. Additionally, complete the Student Survey linked below.

### 2025-05-19: Student Survey (Required)

All students who are interested in taking the course (registered, waitlisted, or otherwise) must **complete the [Student Survey](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/m4Z8DqTKfL)** as soon as possible. Failure to submit the survey before first day of class can jeopardize your registration for CIS 5650.

## Course Description

A timeline section from the following topics:

* **GPU Computing**: GPU architecture, massively parallel programming, parallel algorithms, performance.
* **Rendering**: Graphics pipeline (rasterization), path tracing, deferred shading, forward+ rendering, VR.
* **APIs**: CUDA, WebGPU, Vulkan.

This is a project-intensive course with significant coding, writing, and presenting. It is **more work** than any other course, but it is worth it.

## Prerequisites

* Passion for computer graphics.
* At least one of:
  * **[CIS 4600/5600](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis4600/current/){:target="_blank"}: Introduction to Computer Graphics.**
  * **CIS 4610/5610: Advance Rendering**
  * Preferably received an A. Knowledge of rasterization and ray tracing.
* Strong C or C++.
* If you have not completed these courses (or equivalents), it is strongly advised that you complete the courses first and take the CIS 5650 course the following year. In case you are unable to take the course in due time for your graduation plans, then it is strongly advised that you thoroughly complete the following projects before starting CIS 5650.
  * [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/)
  * WebGPU
    * [WebGPU Fundamentals](https://github.com/webgpu/webgpufundamentals)
    * [Your First WebGPU App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app)
    * [Get started with GPU Compute on the web](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/gpu-compute)
* Also useful:
  * CIS 3800: Operating Systems
  * CIS 5010: Computer Architecture

## Academic Integrity

An academic integrity violation will result in the student receiving an F in this course.

See [Academic Integrity at the University of Pennsylvania: A Guide for Students](http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/){:target="_blank"}.

**Code submissions will be cross-checked for plaigarism against previous years' submissions as well as submissions from your colleagues using automated software. <u>Please do not copy code.</u>**

If you would like to use code not written by you for this class, please run it by the TAs using Class Forum for permission to use it. Examples of code you will need to ask permission to use:

* Public Github Repositories and other open source projects.
* Projects from other classes that will give you a non-trivial advantage for the project.

If you think you need to ask permission, you should ask. We will most likely approve all reasonable requests.
